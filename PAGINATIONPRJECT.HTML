        <h2>BADMNTON</h2>
        <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with
        larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players
        per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a
        rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the other
        team's half of the court.
        
        Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck
        the floor or ground, or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing
        side.[1]
        
        The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile that flies differently from the balls used in
        many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more
        rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the
        shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature, and in certain languages the sport is named by reference to this
        feature (e.g., German Federball, literally feather-ball).The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. European play came to be
        dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated by China. In 1992,
        badminton debuted as a Summer Olympic sport with four events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's
        doubles;[2] mixed doubles was added four years later. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness:
        players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good
        motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements involving much greater flexibility in the
        wrist than some other racquet sports.[3]

        Games employing shuttlecocks have been played for centuries across Eurasia,[a] but the modern game of badminton
        developed in the mid-19th century among the expatriate officers of British India as a variant of the earlier game of
        battledore and shuttlecock. ("Battledore" was an older term for "racquet".)[4] Its exact origin remains obscure. The
        name derives from the Duke of Beaufort's Badminton House in Gloucestershire,[5] but why or when remains
        unclear.[citation needed] As early as 1860, a London toy dealer named Isaac Spratt published a booklet entitled
        Badminton Battledore â€“ A New Game, but no copy is known to have survived.[6] An 1863 article in The Cornhill Magazine
        describes badminton as "battledore and shuttlecock played with sides, across a string suspended some five feet from the
        ground".[7]
